As a UX Designer/Developer, I have embarked on this project with the aim of enhancing my skills and knowledge while gaining valuable hands-on experience. The primary objective is to apply the principles and techniques learned from the book and other resources to create a practical real-world e-commerce website. Although the book primarily focuses on wireframing, I intend to take this project through the entire software development lifecycle [SDLC][SDLC], encompassing analysis, design, development, and testing stages.

Furthermore, I am dedicated to documenting and sharing my progress. I also look forward to receiving valuable feedback and suggestions from the community, which will further enhance the project and my own growth.
