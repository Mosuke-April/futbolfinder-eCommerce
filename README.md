As a User-centered Designer/Developer, I have embarked on this project with the aim of enhancing my skills and knowledge while gaining valuable hands-on experience. The primary objective is to apply the principles and techniques learned from this book and other resources to create a practical real-world e-commerce website. Although the book primarily focuses on wireframing, I intend to take this project through the entire software development lifecycle [SDLC][SDLC], encompassing analysis, design, development, and testing stages.

Furthermore, I am dedicated to documenting and sharing my progress. I also look forward to receiving valuable feedback and suggestions from the community, which will further enhance the project and my own growth.

> This project involves the analysis, design, and development of an e-commerce website for selling soccer equipment and related accessories. The client has already established a small company and taken the initial steps of hiring a back-end developer, acquiring the domain name, and commissioning a logo design.

## Analysis

The analysis phase of the project is crucial for gathering information, conducting research, and evaluating various aspects related to the e-commerce website. The primary goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the project requirements, target audience, and competitive landscape. This phase lays the foundation for the subsequent stages of design and development, ensuring that they are focused, effective, and aligned with the project goals.

>As there is no actual client for this example project, a stakeholder interview was not conducted. However, to gather key information and insights, multiple questionnaires were developed.

### Competitive Assessment

The competitive assessment plays a significant role in understanding the market landscape. By evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of competitors and identifying industry leaders, valuable insights into market trends and customer preferences can be obtained. The assessment involves examining the features, functionalities, and positioning strategies employed by competitors.

A comprehensive questionnaire has been developed to facilitate the competitive assessment. The questionnaire aims to gather information about the competitors, their strengths and weaknesses, and the unique aspects that make industry leaders stand out.

A brief overview of the questionnaire is provided below. The complete questionnaire can be found [*here*](./Analysis/Competitive-Assessment/	Competitor-Questionnaire.odt) - inside the Analysis folder.
